# Philosophers

Ket understanding of following concepts:
- Threads: Each philo is seperate thread, allowing simultanous actions like **thinking**, **eating** and **sleeping.**
- Mutexes: Prevent multi threads accessing shared resourses(forks), thus avoiding race condition.
- Deadlocks: Action that philos holds 1 folk and waits for the other
- Starvation: Ensure very philo get a chance to eat and nonne are left waiting indefinitely.
